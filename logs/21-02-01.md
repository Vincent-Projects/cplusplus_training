The file that contains the binary file from the compilation process is called the object file. ( test.o or test.obj ). Once the files are compiled to object files, they are linked together with the linker.
The makefile is used to describe how works the build of the program

To compile the folder

```bash
$ g++ file.cpp -o file.o
```

To use a makefile create a file named 'Makefile'

```
<KEY_TARGET>: <SOURCE_FILE>
    g++ <SOURCE_FILE> -o <TARGET_FILE>
```

Exemple
main.cpp

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World !" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Makefile

```
main: clean main.cpp
    g++ main.cpp -o build/main.o

clean:
    rm -rf build/*
```

Here i defined the keyword clean for the command rm -rf build/\* which will delete all the files in the build folder. When main will be called first clean will be executed then the g++ command will be executed. This is usedful to first compile all cpp file then execute the main file.

You can then run `make main` or `make clean`
