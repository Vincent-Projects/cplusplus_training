Computers understand only one language which is binary. 0 and 1.
To compile C++ file into computers language we use a compiler. Here i use GCC compiler.
To compile C++ file run the command :

```
g++ file.cpp -o file
```

-o option stands for output which is meant to specify the name of output file.

### Comment

Comment in C++ are `//` and `/* */`

### Preprocessor Directives

When using `#`, it will specify a directive for the preprocessor

### Namespaces

the standard library comes with mehtods like cout from std. to use it `std::cout` but the version wihtout std is called unqualified name ( `cout` ).
`std::cout` select the specific method cout in the std namespace.

In order to use outside methods the program need to refer to the namespace either by using the namespace name ( so for the cout method we need to use the namespace std ) or using the line `using namespace std;`

### Identifiers

Here is all the C++ reserved keywords that are used as identifiers. C++ is case sensitive

```c++
alignas, alignof, and, and_eq, asm, auto, bitand, bitor, bool, break, case, catch, char, char16_t, char32_t, class, compl, const, constexpr, const_cast, continue, decltype, default, delete, do, double, dynamic_cast, else, enum, explicit, export, extern, false, float, for, friend, goto, if, inline, int, long, mutable, namespace, new, noexcept, not, not_eq, nullptr, operator, or, or_eq, private, protected, public, register, reinterpret_cast, return, short, signed, sizeof, static, static_assert, static_cast, struct, switch, template, this, thread_local, throw, true, try, typedef, typeid, typename, union, unsigned, using, virtual, void, volatile, wchar_t, while, xor, xor_eq
```

### Types

There is basic types like char, int, float, bool.
the void type mean there is no type. and the nullptr is used for a special type of pointer.
There is types that are based on the type above which are named compound data type.

### Declaration of Variables

The first method is called **c-like initialization** because it is inherited from C. We use the equal sign `int age = 22;`.
The second method is called **constructor initialization** which consist of encapsulate the value in parenthesis. `int age(22);`.
The third method is called **uniform initialization** like constructor initialization but with curly braces `int age{22};`.
All initialization are valid with basic types.

We can use type deduction when we don't have other solution to do so. the auto keyword can replace the type like `auto age = 22;`, or using the same type as another variable

```c++
int age = 22;
decltype(age) foo = 34;
```

To use string we can use the standard library of C++.

```c++
#include <string> // The string type is a compound type
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name = "Vincent";
    string n("Here");
    string a{"Another one"}; // All initialization are valid with string
    cout << name << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

To represent a string we use double quote and for a single char we use single quote.
When declaring float or long we use respectivly `f` and `l`.
And for unsigned we use `u`

```c+
float pi = 3.1415L;
long u = 6.02e23f; // or F
```

The order of letter for type does not matter ( `34.234ul` === `34.234lu` )

To write string multiple line without inpact on output use `\`

```c++
string sentence = "something here \
to tell"; // === "something here to tell"
```

we can use `nullptr` to create a null pointer;

To use constant use the `const` keyword.
Another way to declare constant we can use the define preprocessor directive. `#define PI 3.14159`. It is the preprocessor that will replace this value so that every code that comes after will have an access to those values. ( so it happens before the compilation time )

### Operations

++ and --
Attention a l'ordre dans laquel cet operation est utilisÃ©.

```
int x = 3;
int y = ++x; // x === 4 | y === 4 ( because ++ is before so first x is incremented and then the value is assign to y )

// Other code

int x = 3;
int y = x++; // x === 4 | y === 3 ( here y is first assign the value of x then x is incremented )
```

We can explicitly cast value using (TYPE) exemple : `i = (int) 3.14;` Here i will be equal to 3. the same can be done like `i = int (3.15)`
we can use sizeof to know the size in byte of a variable : `x = sizeof(i)`

### Basic I/O

To get a char use `cin` to get a line use `getline(cin, your_variable)`
We can use sstream header to use the stringstream method to convert a string to numeric and numeric to string.

```c++
string input;
cout << "What is your age ?\n";
getline(cin, input);
int age = 0;
stringstream(name) >> age;
```

You can call a function inline `inline string myFunc(){}` which save load, stack.

You can use overload which mean that you can create the same function two times but with different type for parameter
And you can also use function templates with `<>`
