Computers understand only one language which is binary. 0 and 1.
To compile C++ file into computers language we use a compiler. Here i use GCC compiler.
To compile C++ file run the command :

```
g++ file.cpp -o file
```

-o option stands for output which is meant to specify the name of output file.

### Comment

Comment in C++ are `//` and `/* */`

### Preprocessor Directives

When using `#`, it will specify a directive for the preprocessor

### Namespaces

the standard library comes with mehtods like cout from std. to use it `std::cout` but the version wihtout std is called unqualified name ( `cout` ).
`std::cout` select the specific method cout in the std namespace.

In order to use outside methods the program need to refer to the namespace either by using the namespace name ( so for the cout method we need to use the namespace std ) or using the line `using namespace std;`

### Identifiers

Here is all the C++ reserved keywords that are used as identifiers. C++ is case sensitive

```c++
alignas, alignof, and, and_eq, asm, auto, bitand, bitor, bool, break, case, catch, char, char16_t, char32_t, class, compl, const, constexpr, const_cast, continue, decltype, default, delete, do, double, dynamic_cast, else, enum, explicit, export, extern, false, float, for, friend, goto, if, inline, int, long, mutable, namespace, new, noexcept, not, not_eq, nullptr, operator, or, or_eq, private, protected, public, register, reinterpret_cast, return, short, signed, sizeof, static, static_assert, static_cast, struct, switch, template, this, thread_local, throw, true, try, typedef, typeid, typename, union, unsigned, using, virtual, void, volatile, wchar_t, while, xor, xor_eq
