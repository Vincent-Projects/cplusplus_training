A c++ file has the extention name of .cpp
To install the compiler for c++ file : `$ sudo apt-get install build-essential`
To compile c++ file : `$ g++ <FILE_NAME> -o <OUTPUT_NAME>` -o is meant to specify the name of the output binary file which will be executed to run the c++ program.
To run the output file : `$ ./<OUTPUT_NAME>`

Q : What is #include <iostream> ?
This is a header file library that will allow us the use of input and output object. cout ( std::cout ) is use as output and we can see the ouput on the console.
cout is pronouced ( see-out ).
Line that starts with # are directive and are read and interpreted by something called preprocessor.

Q : What is a namespace ? And what is using namespace std ?
We can ommit the use of `using namespace std` to use `std::cout`
"A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries."
I'll ommit the use of namespace for now and learn more deeper about it later.

Q : What is '<<' ?
This operator ( the insertion operator ) combine with cout is used to output value.
This can also be use to concatenate two string for exemple : `std::cout << "My name is " << name;

Q : What is the preprocessor ?
The extension name doesn't matter for the c++ preprocessor. It will replace the #include directive with the code inside the file as mentionned by #include.
"The first step that the compiler will do on a source file is run the preprocessor on it". Header files are not passed to compiler

We can insert a new line either using \n or use endl : `std::cout << "Hello World !" << std::endl;
C++ comments are the same as in JS using either // or /\* \*/
Unlike JS c++ use explicite type for variable declaration :

-   int ( 4 bytes )
-   double ( 8 bytes ) ( upt to 15 digits precisions )
-   float ( 4 bytes ) ( up to 6, 7 digits precisions )
-   char ( 1 bytes ) ( letters, ASCII character )
-   string
-   bool ( 1 bytes )

It is possible to declare multiple variables : `int x = 50, y = 30;`
We can declare constant variable that could not be change once declared.
` const float pi = 3.14`
To take the user input we can use cin from the standard library ( std );
As the cin allow the program to take an input from the user we will not use << for this but >> which has the same meaning but in the reverse sens.

To make use of string value use the string library. ( std::string ). string is an object which means it has functions for exemple the concatenation can be made using

```c++
std::string name = "Vincent";
std::string lastname = " Rouilhac";
std::string fullname = name.append(lastname);
```

The + operator will mean either addition for number or concatenation for string.
To get the length of a string ( std::string object ) use .length() or .size()
To find any character in a string use [] with a number which will represent the index of the string. ( See it as an array ).
You can change a value at a specify index using =

cin consider a white space as a terminating character so to take a full line from user use getline fonction. getline(cin, <VARIABLE>); the first argument is a function to read a line of text ( an input )

We can create array using [] and {}

```c++
std::string names[4] = {"Vincent", "Jules", "John", "Will" };
```

A variable can be use to store a reference to another one using &

```c++
std::string name = "Vincent";
std::string &nameRef = name;

nameRef = "John";

std::cout << name; // OUT : John
```

& can also be used to get the memory adress of a variable

```c++
std::cout << &name; // OUT : 0x6dfed4
```

Reference & Pointers are important concepts in C++
A pointer is a variable that store the memory adress of a variable

```c++
std::string* pointer = &name;
// to change the value at the pointer ( memory adress )
*pointer = "Another"; // OUT : Another
```

Your can use default parameter to function using =

```c++
void func(char t = 'e') {
    // Code here
}
```

Function overload is creating the same function many time but taking different type of arguments

```c++
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

double add(double x, double y) {
    return x + y
}
```

You can create classes using class keyword and attribute the arguments that can be used outside of the class under the public keyword

```c++
class Person {
    public: // this is the access specifier ( public | private | protected )
        int age;
        std::string name;
        void sayHi() { // to define the method inside the class
            std::cout << age;
        }
        void sayHello(); // to define the method outside the class
};

void Person::sayHello() { // defined outside the class
    std::cout << "Hello world !";
}

int main() {
    Person p;
    std::cout << p.age; // To access the public property of class
}
```

Take care of the ; after the class declaration
The constructor may have the save name that the class

```c++
class Human {
    public:
        std::string name;
        Human(std::string name) {
            name = name;
        }
};

int main() {
    Human h("Vincent");
}
```

You can use inheritance

```c++
class Animal {

}

class Cat: public Animal { // you can add multiple inheritance

}
```

hpp files are used to create header in order to make a class known from an other.
